üí° About Me

I have a degree in Psychology and am a Data Analyst, with experience in education, data analysis, project management, and technology. Throughout my career, I have combined a human approach with analytics and innovation, participating in projects ranging from data visualization and BI to mentoring and training in digital tools.

I am passionate about the intersection of people, data, and technology: how information can improve processes, decisions, and experiences. I have worked in academic, corporate, and public environments, driving digital transformation processes, designing interactive dashboards, and training in Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Power Platform, and Fabric.

Currently, I continue my training in cloud services, automation, and low-code, seeking to integrate data analysis, UX, and organizational strategy to generate impact and sustainable value.
